# Api.ai - sample webhook implementation in Python

This is a really simple webhook implementation that gets Api.ai classification JSON (i.e. a JSON output of Api.ai /query endpoint) and returns a fulfillment response.

The service packs the result in the Api.ai webhook-compatible response JSON and returns it to Api.ai.
